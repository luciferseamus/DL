REM Also special thanks to I-Am-Jakoby for his creation of the Jumpscare 2.0 which is where I learned what little I know about .ps1 files.  All of this was borrowed and re-worked to accomplish my goal!
REM     Title: JumpScare 2.0
REM     Author: I am Jakoby
REM     Description: This is a one liner payload that will execute and wait until a mouse movement is detected and do a jumpscare
REM     Target: Windows 10, 11

REM  Converted to .js (still in the works) and then added the .ps1 element by Luciferseamus - reason- I wanted to be able to run this but have the option to delay the effect.  I couldn't figure out how to do it via .txt (ACTUALLY I DID!!) file so I am working on a .js verion
REM  It seemed easier after messing with PS commands for almost an entire month. I did learn alot however!  
REM  I could not have done any of this without inspiration from these three Titans and the entire f0 community. Thanks to all of you for inspiring me to undertake this project.
REM UPDATE (08/30/2024):NOW INCLUDING - Wait for mouse option!

REM  Currently set for 5 seconds
REM There are multiple .ps1 scripts in the zip file. they all start with t the next character designates (h)ours, (m)minutes or (s)econds.  example 'ts30.ps1' = typer with a delay of 30 seconds. I pre-made 5
REM  second, 30 sec, 1 minute, 30 min, 1 hour and 3 hrs. none of them are set to repeat but if anyone wants I can add that or you can edit the .ps1 file and adjust the repeat quantity.
REM all of the files will delete themselves after running as well as the zip, clear run box history and empty the recycle bin.
REM Also included is t1.ps1 so you can verify things are being cleaned up without having to sit through the entire script 
REM UPDATE (08/30/2024):NOW INCLUDING - Wait for mouse option! to use replace \'t*.ps1' with \'Wm.ps1' 
REM Currently delay is set for 30sec. after mouse movement is detected.
